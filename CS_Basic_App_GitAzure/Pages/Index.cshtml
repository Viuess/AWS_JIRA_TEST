        <h2>Jira</h2>
        <p>Jira is a central tool used to create this project by tracking workflow management. Jira allows students to see firsthand how software teams plan and organize their work in real time. Using Jira, we have learned how to define tasks and assign responsibilities. This has enabled us to simulate how a business would operate. Through this experience, we have gained practical experience working in agile development and professional communication. These skills directly translate into professional DevOps career fields.</p>

        <h2>AWS</h2>
        <p>AWS provided the cloud environment for us to apply DevOps practically. Using services like EC2 and S3, we were able to use virtual servers and data storage. We also used IAM for managing user access. AWS also provides a practical example of using CodePipelines and CodeBuild, which allow for continuous integration and deployment. Through using these tools, we have been able to see firsthand how companies have integrated the cloud into their workforce. These experiences lead directly into DevOps careers and jobs.</p>

        <h2>How the Pipeline Works</h2>
        <p>
             Our DevOps pipeline connects to GitHub, Jira, and AWS to create a smooth and automated development process.  It starts with Jira, where we organize tasks and issues to our team.  Once a task is defined, a group memeber uses GitHub to write and manage code through pull and push requests which are linked to Jira issues.  When the code is pushed to the main branch, AWS CodePipeline automatically triggers the deployment process.  CodeBuild compiles and tests the code, ensuring that it is ready for deployment.  Finally it is deployed to EC2 and S3.  This automated workflow emulates how modern workforces have integrated cloud-based tools.
